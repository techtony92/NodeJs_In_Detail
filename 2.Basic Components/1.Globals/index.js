/**
 * * Globals
 * 
 * * Like the browser, NodeJs comes with some practical globals for us the use in out applications
 * *
 * * Common
 * * ----------------------
 * * ** global : Think of this as like window but for Node.Js. Don't Abuse It.
 * * ** __dirname : This global is a `String` value that points to the directory name of the file it's used in.
 * * ** __filename : Like __filename, it too is relative to the file it's written in. A `String` value that points to the file name.
 * * ** process : A Swiss army knife global. An `Object` that contains all the context you need about the current program being executed. 
 * *              Things from env vars, to what machine you're on.,=
 * * ** exports, module, require: These globals are used for creating and exposing modules throughout your app. More on these later.
