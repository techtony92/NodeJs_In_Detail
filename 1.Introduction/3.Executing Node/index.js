 * 
 * * NodeJs is a environment were javascript code runs. This is different from browsers
 * * Node does not have the same API's that browsers do, do no alert(), no window, etc etc.
 * * Very important to understand where your javascript code is gonna be ran, because that 
 * * environment determines what API's are available for you to use.
 * * Anything DOM related does not work in nodeJS.
